# gmi2gopher

This is a barebones utility I use to convert `.gmi` documents from a Gemini capsule to either `gophermap` or plain text formats for gopher. This allows me to write content for a Gemini capsule, and the autoconvert it over to a Gopherhole without having to maintain versions of the same site.
